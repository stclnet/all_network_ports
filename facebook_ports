‚úÖ Ports Used by Facebook (Mobile App, PC App, Browser)
These ports allow general access to Facebook services including messaging, video, voice, and real-time notifications.

1. TCP Ports
Port	Purpose
80	Standard HTTP (web traffic)
443	HTTPS (secure web traffic) ‚Äî most important
5222	XMPP messaging protocol (used for Facebook Chat/Meta Messenger)
8080	Alternate HTTP (occasionally used)

2. UDP Ports
Port	Purpose
3478-3481	STUN/TURN (used for WebRTC: voice/video calls)
49152‚Äì65535	Dynamic/ephemeral ports used in WebRTC peer-to-peer connections

üí° Notes:
Port 443 (HTTPS) is essential for Facebook access on all platforms.

WebRTC ports (UDP 3478‚Äì3481) are used when making audio/video calls via Messenger on browser or mobile.

Facebook apps (mobile or PC) do not require manual port forwarding in normal home networks unless you're behind a restrictive firewall or using enterprise-level NAT.

üîê Tips for Network Configuration
Ensure your firewall/router allows outgoing connections to the ports above.

Enable UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) on your router ‚Äî it helps dynamically open ports for apps like Facebook Messenger during voice/video calls.

Avoid over-restrictive firewall rules unless absolutely necessary.
