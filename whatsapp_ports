WhatsApp uses various ports depending on the platform and communication type (messages, calls, file transfers, etc.). 
If you want to forward ports for WhatsApp to improve connectivity on mobile, browser, or PC, here are the ports to forward:

‚úÖ WhatsApp Ports to Forward (All Platforms: Mobile, Web, PC)
TCP Ports (for messaging, media, and web access):
80 ‚Äì Standard HTTP

443 ‚Äì HTTPS (used for WhatsApp Web and WhatsApp Desktop)

5222 ‚Äì XMPP messaging protocol

5223 ‚Äì Secure messaging (legacy use)

UDP Ports (used for voice and video calls):
3478

3479

4244

49152‚Äì65535 ‚Äì Dynamic ports for peer-to-peer media (especially for voice/video calls)

üîÑ Platform Breakdown
Platform	Ports Needed
Mobile App	TCP: 80, 443, 5222, 5223
UDP: 3478‚Äì3479, 49152‚Äì65535
WhatsApp Web	TCP: 443 (essential), 80
WhatsApp PC App	Same as WhatsApp Web, plus optional UDP 3478‚Äì3479 for call support

üîê Notes:
WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption; port forwarding won‚Äôt expose message content.

Most routers allow WhatsApp to function fine without forwarding due to NAT traversal and STUN support.

Port forwarding is only necessary in restricted network environments (e.g., strict corporate firewalls, or double NAT setups).

‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder:
Only forward ports if you're confident in your network setup.

Consider setting a static IP for the device receiving the forwarded traffic.

Do not open 49152‚Äì65535 globally unless absolutely necessary‚Äîuse port triggering or limit to known device IPs.
